This paper delves into the evaluation of low-power, high-speed designs of SET, DET, TSPC, and C2CMOS Flip-
Flops at 90nm technology. These compact topologies offer reduced area and power consumption, applicable
across digital VLSI clocking systems, buffers, and microprocessors. Using DSCH and Microwind tools, the study
compares these Flip-Flops in terms of area, transistor count, power dissipation, and propagation delay. It
emphasizes the use of recent CMOS micron layout tools to develop low-power chips, aligning with advancements
in chip manufacturing technology. Specifically, the project focuses on True Single Phase Clocking (TSPC) and
C2CMOS flip flops, comparing them against existing topologies, analyzing parameters such as area, transistor
count, power dissipation, propagation delay, and parasitic values through Microwind simulations.
